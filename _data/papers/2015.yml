    We present a suite of algorithms for inference tasks over (finite and infinite) context-free sets. 
    For generality and clarity, we have chosen the framework of semiring parsing with support to the most common semirings (e.g. Forest, Viterbi, k-best and Inside). 
    We see parsing from the more general viewpoint of weighted deduction allowing for arbitrary weighted finite-state input and provide implementations of both bottom-up (CKY-inspired) and top-down (Earley-inspired) algorithms. 
    We focus on approximate inference by Monte Carlo methods and provide implementations of ancestral sampling and slice sampling. In principle, sampling methods can deal with models whose independence assumptions are weaker than what is feasible by standard dynamic programming. 
    We envision applications such as monolingual constituency parsing, synchronous parsing, context-free models of reordering for machine translation, and machine translation decoding.

      In the print version, Equation 3 is incorrect. I intended to first discuss the univariate slice sampler (Neal, 2003) and then introduce the multivariate extension of Blunsom and Cohn (2010). In shortening the text, I misrepresented f(d,u) by mixing its definition with the univariate case. A complete and correct specification of f(d, u) is present in the electronic version.

    Spoken language translation (SLT) combines automatic speech recognition (ASR) and machine translation (MT). During the decoding stage, the best hypothesis produced by the ASR system may not be the best input candidate to the MT system, but making use of multiple sub-optimal ASR results in SLT has been shown to be too complex computationally. This paper presents a method to rescore the k-best ASR output such as to improve translation quality. A translation quality estimation model is trained on a large number of features which aim to capture complementary information from both ASR and MT on translation difficulty and adequacy, as well as syntactic properties of the SLT inputs and outputs. Based on the predicted quality score, the ASR hypotheses are rescored before they are fed to the MT system. ASR confidence is found to be crucial in guiding the rescoring step. In an English-to-French speech-to-text translation task, the coupling of ASR and MT systems led to an increase of 0.5 BLEU points in translation quality.
