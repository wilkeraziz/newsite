    As Machine Translation (MT) becomes more popular among end-users, an increasingly relevant issue is that of estimating the quality of automatic translations for a particular task. The main application for such quality estimates has been selecting good enough translations for human post-editing. The end-users, in this case, are fluent speakers of both source and target languages and the quality estimates reflect post-editing effort, for example, the time to post-edit a sentence. This paper focuses on quality estimation to address the challenging problem of making MT more reliable to a different type of end-user: those who cannot read the source language. We propose a number of indicators contrasting the source and translation texts to predict the adequacy of such translations at the sentence-level. Experiments with Arabic-English MT show that these indicators can yield improvements over previous work using general quality indicators based on source complexity and target fluency.

    This paper reports the fully automatic compilation of parallel corpora for Brazilian Portuguese. Scientific news texts available in Brazilian Portuguese, English and Spanish are automatically crawled from a multilingual Brazilian magazine. The texts are then automatically aligned at document- and sentence-level. The resulting corpora contain about 2,700 parallel documents totaling over 150,000 aligned sentences each. The quality of the corpora and their usefulness are tested in an experiment with machine translation.
