    We present a new Bayesian HMM word alignment model for statistical machine translation. The model is a mixture of an alignment model and a language model. The alignment component is a Bayesian extension of the standard HMM. The language model component is responsible for the generation of words needed for source fluency reasons from source language context. This allows for untranslatable source words to remain unaligned and at the same time avoids the introduction of artificial NULL words which introduces unusually long alignment jumps. Existing Bayesian word alignment models are unpractically slow because they consider each target position when resampling a given alignment link. The sampling complexity therefore grows linearly in the target sentence length. In order to make our model useful in practice, we devise an auxiliary variable Gibbs sampler that allows us to resample alignment links in constant time independently of the target sentence length. This leads to considerable speed improvements. Experimental results show that our model performs as well as existing word alignment toolkits in terms of resulting BLEU score.

      We study the relationship between word order freedom and preordering in statistical machine translation. To assess word order freedom, we first introduce a novel entropy measure which quantifies how difficult it is to predict word order given a source sentence and its syntactic analysis. We then address preordering for two target languages at the far ends of the word order freedom spectrum, German and Japanese, and argue that for languages with more word order freedom, attempting to predict a unique word order given source clues only is less justified. Subsequently, we examine lattices of n-best word order predictions as a unified representation for languages from across this broad spectrum and present an effective solution to a resulting technical issue, namely how to select a suitable source word order from the lattice during training. Our experiments show that lattices are crucial for good empirical performance for languages with freer word order (English-German) and can provide additional improvements for fixed word order languages (English-Japanese).

      In word alignment certain source words are only needed for fluency reasons and do not have a translation on the target side. Most word alignment models assume a target NULL word from which they generate these untranslatable source words. Hypothesising a target NULL word is not without problems, however. For example, because this NULL word has a position, it interferes with the distribution over alignment jumps. We present a word alignment model that accounts for untranslatable source words by generating them from preceding source words. It thereby removes the need for a target NULL word and only models alignments between word pairs that are actually observed in the data. Translation experiments on English paired with Czech, German, French and Japanese show that the model outperforms its traditional IBM counterparts in terms of BLEU score.
