  abstract: >
    The combinatorial space of translation derivations in phrase-based statistical machine translation is given by the intersection between a translation lattice and a target language model.
    We replace this intractable intersection by a tractable relaxation which incorporates a low-order upperbound on the language model.
    Exact optimisation is achieved through a coarse-to-fine strategy with connections to adaptive rejection sampling.
    We perform exact optimisation with unpruned language models of order 3 to 5 and show search-error curves for beam search and cube pruning on standard test sets.
    This is the first work to tractably tackle exact optimisation with language models of orders higher than 3.
  errata: >
    In the introduction, we comment about works that propose some form of exact search. In some cases, authors have proposed algorithms whose applicability seems mostly limited to toy models, such as Aziz et al. (2013). In other cases, authors modified the model in different (non-obvious) ways (e.g. monotone translation, compact rule sets, lower-order LM, entropy pruning for LM) enabling exact search. We mistakenly listed Iglesias et al (2009) amongst the former group, thus misrepresenting their contribution.
    A more accurate wording would be:
    
    *To date, most attempts were limited to short sentences and/or somewhat toy models trained with artificially small datasets (Germann et al., 2001; Aziz et al., 2013). Other work has employed less common approximations to the model reducing its search space complexity (Kumar et al., 2006; Iglesias et al., 2009; Chang and Collins, 2011; Rush and Collins, 2011).*

    I thank Gonzalo Iglesias for kindly warning me about this problem.

    The University of Sheffield (USFD) participated in the International Workshop for Spoken Language Translation (IWSLT) in 2014. In this paper, we will introduce the USFD SLT system for IWSLT. Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is achieved by two multi-pass deep neural network systems with adaptation and rescoring techniques. Machine translation (MT) is achieved by a phrase-based system. The USFD primary system incorporates state-of-the-art ASR and MT techniques and gives a BLEU score of 23.45 and 14.75 on the English-to-French and English-to-German speech-to-text translation task with the IWSLT 2014 data. The USFD contrastive systems explore the integration of ASR and MT by using a quality estimation system to rescore the ASR outputs, optimising towards better translation. This gives a fur- ther 0.54 and 0.26 BLEU improvement respectively on the IWSLT 2012 and 2014 evaluation data.
