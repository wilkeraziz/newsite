* **2024**
  * Two papers accepted at EACL2024! Come talk to us about _uncertainty in NLP_, we will be presenting about [methodology to evaluate LM's calibration against human uncertainty]() and [confidence vs. label variation](), see you in Malta!
  * [UncertaiNLP](https://uncertainlp.github.io)'s programme has been finalised, we have a great line-up of invited talks and accepted papers. See you in Malta!
* **2023**
  * The first edition of our workshop on uncertainty-aware NLP is going to be in Malta! Check our [cfp](https://uncertainlp.github.io)!
  * The work we started at the [Third ELLIS NLP Workshop](https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/seminars/seminar-calendar/seminar-details/22474) in Dagstuhl is now out, [check our pre-print](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15703)!
  * [Evaluating uncertainty in neural text generators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11707) has been accepted at EMNLP2023!
  * [Vision DiffMask](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06391) (faithful attributions for visual transformers) will appear at XAI4CV, go talk to Tinos at CVPR!
  * My daughter was born <3 (I guess this space is about to get a bit quieter, unlike my home :p)!
* **2022**
  * Two papers accepted at EMNLP 2022: [sampling-based MBR for NMT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04718) and [calibration of text classifiers under human disagreement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16133)
  * ~~I am [hiring a PhD candidate](https://probabll.github.io/jobs/) to work on uncertainty and language generation, apply before 21 August 2022!~~
  * I gave a talk at [Structure Prediction for NLP](http://structuredprediction.github.io/SPNLP22) ([slides](https://probabll.github.io/slides/spnlp2022.pdf), [colab demo](https://colab.research.google.com/github/probabll/demo-mbr-nmt/blob/main/German-English.ipynb)).
  * [Deep Learning 2 course](https://uvadl2c.github.io) is ready!
  * [Sparse communication via mixed distributions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.02658.pdf) has been accepted at ICLR2022!
* **2021**
  * 2 EMNLP2021 papers led by Nicola De Cao: [Editing Factual Knowledge in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08164) and [Highly Parallel Autoregressive Entity Linking with Discriminative Correction]().
  * In [this followup](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04718) to our [Coling2020 paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.coling-main.398/) we take MBR decoding from proof-of-concept to a robust and scalable decision rule.
  * Another collaboration with DeepSPIN! This time we provide [a formal account to mixed random variables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02658) and take the first steps towards a theory of communication using sparse continuous random variables.
  * ~~PhD and postdoc positions at the newly established [Mercury Machine Learning Lab](https://icai.ai/mercury-machine-learning-lab/) (a collaboration among Booking.com, TUDelft, and UvA) including [2 PhD position in ML/NLP](https://www.uva.nl/en/content/vacancies/2021/07/21-579-phd-4-and-postdoc-1-position-in-machine-learning.html?origin=FpX8Wqb2Sua7FLtTRS6KDw&cb), together with [Ivan Titov](http://ivan-titov.org). Deadline: August 23, 2021.~~  
  * I gave a [talk at the IST and Unbabel Seminars](https://ist-unbabel-seminars.github.io/past_seminars)
  * I gave a [talk at JHU's Center for Language and Speech Processing](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/events/wilker-aziz-university-of-amsterdam/#.YtajHy8Rp-U)
  * I gave a [talk at the University of Helsinki's Language Technology Seminar](https://blogs.helsinki.fi/language-technology/research-seminar-spring-2021/)
