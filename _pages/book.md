I am trying to organise my lecture notes in what looks like a book. It will sure be a while before I can share a single (coherent) pdf, so I'm sharing drafts of individual chapters here.

* [Appendix B - Probability Theory](/assets/pdfs/lecture-notes-appendix-B.pdf)
* Appendix C - Probabilistic graphical models: [slides (directed case)](/assets/pdfs/slides-appendix-PGM.pdf) [video (directed case)](https://youtu.be/9lmFfhzpWag) 
* [Chapter 3 - Generative Models of Text Classification](/assets/pdfs/generative.pdf)
* [Chapter 4 - Discriminative Models of Text Classification and Regression](/assets/pdfs/discriminative.pdf)
